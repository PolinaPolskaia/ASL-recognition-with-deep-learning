In this project, I built a convolutional neural network to classify images of letters from American Sign Language.
American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language used by many deaf individuals in North America, and it is also used by hard-of-hearing and hearing individuals. The language is as rich as spoken languages and employs signs made with the hand, along with facial gestures and bodily postures.

A lot of recent progress has been made towards developing computer vision systems that translate sign language to spoken language. This technology often relies on complex neural network architectures that can detect subtle patterns in streaming video. However, as a first step, towards understanding how to build a translation system, we can reduce the size of the problem by translating individual letters, instead of sentences.

After loading, examining, and preprocessing the data, I trainED the network and testED its performance.

Project workflow:

* Loading the ASL Image Dataset
* Examining the Dataset
* One-hot encoding the data
* Defining the model
* Compiling the model
* Training the model
* Testing the model
